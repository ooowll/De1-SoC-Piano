# Piano Synthesizer on DE1-SoC FPGA  

This project implements a digital piano synthesizer on the **DE1-SoC FPGA** platform, controlled through a **PS/2 keyboard**. The system converts user input into audio tones and visual feedback, simulating a traditional piano with digital enhancements.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🎹 **13 unique tones** mapped to PS/2 keyboard inputs  
- 🔊 **Real-time audio output** to stereo speakers  
- 🖥️ **VGA display** for visual feedback of pressed keys  
- ⏺️ **Recording & playback** of up to 10 seconds of user input  
- ⚙️ Modular design with separate controllers for audio, VGA, and input handling  

## 🛠️ System Overview  
- **Input**: PS/2 keyboard for key detection  
- **Processing**: FPGA logic on the DE1-SoC handles tone generation, VGA updates, and memory management  
- **Output**: Real-time audio to speakers and visual key highlights on VGA  

## 🚀 Future Extensions  
- 🎶 Improved audio synthesis techniques for richer sound quality  
- 🎼 Support for external MIDI keyboard input via microcontroller interface  
- 🎨 Enhanced VGA graphics with more dynamic animations  

## 👥 Authors  
- **Harish Babu** – PS/2 Controller, VGA Controller, On-board memory integration  
- **Dylan Ho** – Audio Controller, Multi-note implementation, Keyboard logic
